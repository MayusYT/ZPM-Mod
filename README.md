# LightBlock

Hi! This is my first Mod that isn't actually made after a tutorial. I did it because of an request from @hiotewdew from the minecraft forum!



Basically, it just changes its texture and light emittance when you right click it. This makes it a variable light source that fits your needs - definitely.



Here is my mod request offer thread on the minecraft forum:Â https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/requests-ideas-for-mods/2938222-i-will-make-you-a-free-custom-mod-block-reloaded
